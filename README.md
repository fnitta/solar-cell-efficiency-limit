# Efficiency Limit of Solar Cells
This repository contains MATLAB code to calculate the fundamental performance limits of single-junction solar cells with a realistic analysis based on the Tiedje-Yablonovitch model and including defect-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. While our work focuses on the efficiency limits of multilayer MoS_2, MoSe_2, WS_2, and WSe_2 solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination, this code can be used to calculate the efficiency limits of any material under any spectrum.

This README serves two purposes:
1. It provides an overview of the MATLAB code we employed to produce the results presented in our paper.
2. It guides users on the necessary modifications and data files required to calculate the efficiency limits of (a) their materials of interest and/or (b) under other spectra.
